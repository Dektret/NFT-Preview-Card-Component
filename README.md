### Continued development

Currently, I am a beginner in frontend web development. I started learning html and css just to develop additional skills. Now, that i have experienced desinging webpages and also knowing the fact that there is more to web designing than just html and css i started to have fun messing with webpages. I found myself consuming more and more content of web development over the internet and even though i understood nothing it was fun to watch and see people creating webpages out of nothing but just code. I am on a journey to learn frontend web development and then to become a full stack developer soon!
